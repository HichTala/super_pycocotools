# Super PyCOCOTool

The super_pycocotools module aims to help manage multiple datasets. Instead of having a list of variables instantiating a dataset each, we propose a dataset management format with a ".json" file gathering all the information of each dataset and a super class that instantiates each dataset and each data type using pycocotools. So each partition of each dataset is accessible by instantiating a single variable

## Installation

The installation is very simple, the package is handled in the package manager pip. All you need to do is executing this line :

```shell
pip install super_pycocotool
```

## Format


## Usage

Please refer to the notebook `super_pycocotools_walkthrough.ipynb` which explain how to use the package.
